This will spin up a VM using CentOS 6.5.

Installed:

Apache HTTPD
PHP
index.php in the docroot

Work in Progress:
Testing an iptables Puppet module to modify the rules properly.

Currently, as suspected, iptables is disabled via Puppet.

This can be modified, but I'd like to use a module to get it right.
